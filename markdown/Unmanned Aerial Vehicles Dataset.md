The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Image Dataset consists of a collection of images containing UAVs, along with
object annotations for the UAVs found in each image. The annotations have been converted into the COCO, YOLO,
and VOC formats for ease of use with various object detection frameworks. The images in the dataset were captured
from a variety of angles and under different lighting conditions, making it a useful resource for training and evaluating
object detection algorithms for UAVs. The dataset is intended for use in research and development of UAV-related
applications, such as autonomous flight, collision avoidance and rogue drone tracking and following. The dataset
consists of the following images and detection objects (Drone):

It is advised to further enhance the dataset so that random augmentations are probabilistically applied to each image
prior to adding it to the batch for training. Specifically, there are a number of possible transformations such as geometric
(rotations, translations, horizontal axis mirroring, cropping, and zooming), as well as image manipulations (illumination
changes, color shifting, blurring, sharpening, and shadowing).
